Thought dump regarding general characteristics of a table top game about alien abductions.

- Each player as an asymmetrical alien race competing to acquire the most profound insights about the human race the quickest through observations and abductions in order to advise their own decisions about expansion via integration or invasion.
- Players spend resources choosing observation and abduction targets and executing their plans and have to handle fallout from mistakes and poor design or reap the rewards from their success.
- The first alien race to achieve either harmonious integration or successfully launch an invasion for planetary domination wins.
- Alien races must deal with a number of constraints in designing and executing their observations, abductions, infiltrations and invasions, including:
	- Available technology
		- Proprietary alien technology specific to your species and/or available through private research
		- General alien technology available through the Alien confederacy 
		- Human technology creating obstacles 
			- Mistakes during observation/abduction may reveal advance technology to mankind giving them incredible advantages
	- Incompatibilities with your alien's biology and earth's environment making it viable as a future habitat (most advantageous), merely for resource extraction or just for waste deposit (least advantageous).
	- Compliance with alien federation requirements or fallout through defiance.
- Gameplay should allow for intense puzzle and resource competition between players with comical backdrops of botched invasions creating humorous scenarios.
